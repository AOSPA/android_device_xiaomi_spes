         NL80211_CMD_WIPHY_REG_CHANGE events which indicate the current country code which is
         being used by the WLAN driver. If the driver doesn't support these events
         (configuration is `false`) then the driver must handle the setCountryCode request from
         HAL as a blocking call. In such a case the country code will be applied
         immediately after the country code is sent to the driver (if the method returns a
         success). -->
